    RuleAssessment is a software platform designed to support structured regulatory assessment of food and food supplement products across multiple markets.
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">
    The platform helps manufacturers, brand owners and regulatory professionals document product assumptions, compare ingredient and dosage data against market specific rules, and identify regulatory constraints early in the product development process.
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">
    RuleAssessment does not provide approvals or legal decisions. The platform functions as a decision support tool based on defined regulatory sources and user provided data.
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">
    Initial focus: EU and UK.
