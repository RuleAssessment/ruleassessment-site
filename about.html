        <h1>Why RuleAssessment exists</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          RuleAssessment is developed by practitioners working daily with EFSA based regulatory assessments, with initial market focus on Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland.

          <p>
            Regulatory assessment work is often fragmented. Assumptions are implicit, interpretations are spread across documents, and conclusions are difficult to review once decisions move forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            RuleAssessment exists to make regulatory reasoning explicit, reviewable, and easier to maintain over time. The system supports professional judgment rather than replacing it, by structuring context, assumptions, and rule comparisons in one place.
          </p>

          <p>
            Responsibility remains with the professionals using the system. RuleAssessment does not provide approvals or decisions, and it does not position itself as an authority.
          </p>

          <p>
            This site reflects that perspective. The focus is on clarity, scope, and responsibility.
